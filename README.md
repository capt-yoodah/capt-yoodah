- 👋 Hi, I’m @capt-yoodah ! I'm new here and pretty much know as much as a baby, but I'd like to know more about coding, security policies & practices, pentesting and bug bounty hunting! I hope to contribute to other's with the same interest as well.
- 👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity and python for ethical hacking at the moment
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Practical Ethical Hacking led by Heath Adams
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on people with the same interest with me!
